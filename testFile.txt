story main concepts: 
- fire introduced to show vulnerability
- give fire to friend, rekindle friendship
- journey to friend involves fighting mental struggles in the form of bosses
- also convo with characters along the way is important for healing
- if speedrun and reach friend with hella debuffs, friend rejects flame
    - friend says they should go reflect on the dmg they caused to get there too
- if player properly heals, they realize problems that made friendship break

random ideas:
- find coins that can be redeemed for cosmetics (change fire color)
- make own SFX
- idle animation ?? (umbrella to protect flame, moving animation or sum idk)
- game is continuous on client side, but will have stages for dev convenience
    - "checkpoint saved" displayed in bottom left after each stage
    - fades to loading screen once player finished stage and walks to right
    - little nightmares type beat

player traits:
- health
    - 3 hearts
- energy bar
    - jump and roll uses energy
    - slowly replenishes constantly, if idle for x seconds, replenish speed mult by 10
- 

debuff ideas:
- depression
    - BOSS: boss in background, have to climb level and avoid drowning. If touch water and escape, water rises faster.
    - energy bar gets smaller
    - movement speed lower (?)
- anxiety
    - BOSS: many small attack; hits add up and freeze you at x amount; can get hit while frozen & amount doesn't change
    - have to complete tasks in certain order/with more detail
- critical point (near death)
    - screen goes darker (?)
